# What is JWT

A **JSON Web Token (JWT)** is an open industry standard ([RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)) used to securely transmit information between two parties, typically a **client and a server**, in a web application or API.

JWTs are **self-contained**, **stateless tokens** that carry all the necessary information for **authentication and authorization** within the token itself, eliminating the need for servers to maintain session data.

## Structure of a JWT

JWTs consist of **three parts**, separated by dots (`.`):

1. **Header**
2. **Payload**
3. **Signature**

### 1. Header
The header contains **metadata** about the token, including:
- The **signing algorithm** (e.g., `HS256`, `RS256`)
- The **token type** (`JWT`)

### 2. Payload
The payload contains **claims**, which are statements about the user or other data. Common claims include:
- **User details**
- **Timestamps** (`iat`, `nbf`)
- **Expiration time** (`exp`)

### 3. Signature
The signature ensures the token's **authenticity and integrity**. It verifies that:
- The **sender** of the JWT is who it claims to be
- The **message** wasn't altered during transmission

By validating the signature, servers can trust the content of the
